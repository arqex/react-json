# React-json docs

Nice! You decided to give react-json a try! You won't regret. React-json is a flexible way of create forms in a fast way and still having the control of it.

**Get started**
If you are starting with react-json, you probably would like to have a look at the get started section. It is a fast way of getting used to react-json configuration and how to get the value on change:

**Settings**
Once you have scratched the surface, it is a good idea to learn the react-json settings to know the library possibilities.

[react-json settings](settings.md)

**Field types**
A react-json component can be defined as a set of fields that can be edited independently. The way that the field data is edited depends on the field type, so it is always nice to know about the different field types:

[Field types](fieldTypes.md)
[Base field types settings](baseFieldTypes.md)
[Creating custom field types](customFieldTypes.md)
[Wrapping react components as field types](wrappingComponents.md)

**Validation**
One of the coolest things of react-json is that it handles validation errors and display customized messages automatically.

[Validate your fields](validation.md)

**Hacking react-json**
React-json tries to add sematic HTML classes to the markup in order to make easy to change its appearance just creating some CSS rules, but it is impossible to satisfy everybody requirements. For those that want more can override methods to get the exact markup that they need. Hack it!
